üçΩÔ∏è Food Explorer: Discover & Savor
A dynamic, responsive, and feature-rich website for exploring delicious meals, browsing categories, and fetching random recipes. The Food Explorer project is designed to inspire users to explore new dishes and cooking techniques in a seamless and modern UI.

üìã Project Overview
Food Explorer is a visually appealing and highly interactive recipe website. It integrates TheMealDB API to offer users a wide variety of meal options, whether chosen randomly or searched by category. This project demonstrates best practices in modern front-end development using HTML5, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, and JavaScript.

Key features include:

Random Recipe Generator: Automatically displays random recipes on page load.
Search by Category: Users can filter recipes by clicking on category buttons such as Chicken, Beef, Soup, etc.
Accordion FAQ Section: A beautifully designed accordion with interactive open/close animations.
Fully Responsive Layout: Built with mobile-first principles, ensuring it works perfectly on all screen sizes.
Interactive Carousel: Displays rotating food images and promotional content.
‚ú® Detailed Project Features
1. Homepage with Random Meal Suggestions
How it Works: When the page first loads, a JavaScript function fetches random meals from TheMealDB API using the /random.php endpoint.
Display: The fetched data is dynamically rendered into a grid of food items. Each item shows the meal name, a description snippet, and a thumbnail image.
2. Category Search Functionality
How it Works: Clicking on any category button (e.g., Chicken, Beef, etc.) triggers a request to TheMealDB API to fetch meals related to that category via the /search.php?s=<category> endpoint.
Fallback: If no category is selected or no results are found, random meals are fetched and displayed as a fallback.
3. FAQ Section
How it Works: The FAQ is designed with an accordion-style interface, using JavaScript to toggle between opening and closing answers. Each question is displayed with an expanding answer that provides more information when clicked.
Animation: The FAQ section features smooth transitions for expanding and collapsing answers, enhancing the user experience.
4. Responsive Design
TailwindCSS & DaisyUI are used to make the layout fully responsive, ensuring seamless user experiences across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
The design is mobile-first, ensuring that the smallest screen sizes are prioritized while scaling beautifully to larger screens.
5. Interactive Carousel
A rotating image carousel showcases highlighted dishes or promotions, with a new image sliding in every 3 seconds.
Users can manually navigate using the next/prev buttons or let the carousel rotate automatically.
‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: Semantic and accessible markup for the structure of the website.
TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for fast styling and responsive design.
DaisyUI: TailwindCSS component library for pre-designed, accessible UI elements.
JavaScript (ES6): Used for API fetching, dynamic content rendering, and interactive elements.
TheMealDB API: Provides real-time meal and recipe data, including random meal suggestions and category-specific results.

üåê API Integration
This project integrates TheMealDB API to provide real-time data on recipes. It utilizes two main API endpoints:

Random Meal Endpoint: Fetches random meals to display when the page is loaded or if no category is selected.

URL: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php
Category Search Endpoint: Fetches meals based on user-selected categories such as Chicken, Beef, etc.

URL: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=<category>
In case the API call fails or returns no data, a fallback function retrieves random meals to maintain a seamless experience for users.
